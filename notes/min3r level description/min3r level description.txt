Okay so this level, simply titled "floor," (It didn't have an official name)
it was meant to... I think use like, the GOLF Knight transformation?

I seriously forget what it was meant to be, but like, eh.

Min3r probably doesn't care all that much anymore, seeing as it never got past like...
four rooms before being abandoned.

Wish I knew what Min3r had planned for this level, but you win some you lose some, IDFK.
Don't try to finish this level, please. I don't really wanna know what Min3r would do if
you did... (He's already pissed at y'all for leaking and/or attempting to revive the Greg
mod. Seriously y'all, why are you Pizza Tower fans so adamant on "leaking mods"? It's not
cool, guys, it only makes people hate this community more and more. God damn.)
