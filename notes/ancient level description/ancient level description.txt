Okay now I actually had an idea for this level.

I was like "Okay, what if..."
"...what if you could play through Ancient Tower (from PT Demo 2), but it's like,
old and dilapidated due to nobody playing the level for such a long time?"

It was an interesting idea to me at the time, but now?
Ehh, i suppose it's pretty tedious, I dunno.

You can try and finish this level, but I don't know how y'all'd take the "ancient tower
but ruined" idea into fruition...
