# PizzaTower_DGMIX
An old pizza tower mod built off of a decomp of the GOLF build.

Pretty much cancelled at this point due to... well... lack of motivation, I suppose?

Do what you want with my modified code, it's not all that good, but who fucking cares at this point?

Just don't reupload it unmodified on sites like GameBanana, archive.org, itch.io, etc. and say that you made it. That's not nice. In fact, don't reupload this unmodified regardless. I don't want that.

And don't report bugs, because I ain't fixin' em.



bluh bluh whatever
